This is a simple project predicting flowers as a type of one of the following iris categories: Iris Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica. The project uses the classic iris dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris/discussion/18365).

After analysis and modelling, the project was implemented on Streamlit (https://rofiatu-iris-predictor-flowers-cempch.streamlit.app/).
